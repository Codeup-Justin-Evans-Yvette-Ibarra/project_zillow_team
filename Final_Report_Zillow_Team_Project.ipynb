    "# Project Overview:\n",
    "This project has been tasked with collecting, cleaning and analyzing Zillow data from 2017 in order to improve a previous prediction model that was designed to predict the Tax Assessed Home Value for Single Family Properties based on available realestate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals: \n",
    "* Discover key attributes that drive error in Zestimate logerror.\n",
    "* Use those attributes to develop a machine learning model to predict logerror.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reproduction of this Data:\n",
    "* Can be accomplished using a local ```env.py``` containing ```user, password, host``` information for access to the Codeup SQL database server.\n",
    "* All other step by step instructions can be found by reading the below Jupyter Notebook files located in our [Codeup-Justin-Evans-Yvette-Ibarra](https://github.com/Codeup-Justin-Evans-Yvette-Ibarra/project_zillow_team.git) github repository.\n",
