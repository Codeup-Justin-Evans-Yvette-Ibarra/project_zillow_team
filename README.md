# Final Report Team Zillow Project

## Group 4
* Justin Evans
* Yvette Ibarra

# Project Overview
Zillowâ€™s Zestimate is a home valuation in the real estate industry and created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market. We will be looking into the log error of Zillow data from 2017 of single family properties to evaluate and analysis the drivers of log error.

# Project Goal
* Discover key attributes that drive error in Zestimate .

* Use those attributes to develop a machine learning model to predict log error.



# Initial Thoughts
Our initial thoughts is that outliers, age, and L.A. County are drivers of errors in Zestimate.

# The Plan
* Acquire data from Codeup database
* Prepare data
* Explore data in search of drivers of home_value
    * Answer the following initial question:
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 

* Develop a Model to predict error in zestimate.
    * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of error using...
    * Evaluate models on train and validate data using RMSE (Root mean square Error)
    * Select the best model based on the least RMSE
    * Evaluate the best model on test data
* Draw conclusions
